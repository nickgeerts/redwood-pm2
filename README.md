# Redwood.js serverfull hosting with PM2

This is an example of serverfull hosting of a Redwood.js app with PM2 and Nginx.

## Requirements

- Linux server
- Nginx
- Postgres
- PM2
- Node
- Yarn

## Configuration

### Linux server

Your server should have a user for deploying the app with. It should be configured with a SSH key pair so you can easily SSH into it from your development environment. In this example this user is named 'deploy'.

### Nginx

Your Nginx configuration file for the app should look something like this. For this example, this file is stored at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/redwood-pm2` and is symbolically linked to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/redwood-pm2`.

Please note that the trailing slash in the proxy_pass value is very essental to correctly map the API functions.

```
server {
  server_name redwood-pm2.example.com;
  listen 80;

  location / {
    root /home/deploy/redwood-pm2/current/web/dist;
  }

  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8911/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```

### PM2

The ecosystem.config.js file is used for PM2 settings. The most important variables are at the top. Note that the port is only used locally on the server.

```javascript
const name = 'redwood-pm2' // Name to use in PM2
const repo = 'git@github.com:njjkgeerts/redwood-pm2.git' // Link to your repo
const path = `/home/deploy/${name}` // Path on the server to deploy to
const user = 'deploy' // Server user
const host = 'example.com' // Server hostname
const port = 8911 // Port to use locally on the server
```

## Deploying

### Preperation

First, we need to create the directories for PM2.

```
yarn install
yarn deploy:setup
```

Your directories at the server are created. However, your `.env` settings are not yet created. SSH into your server and create an `.env` file.

```
vim /home/deploy/redwood-pm2/current/.env
```

In the example we only need an DATABASE_URL variable.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/redwood-pm2
```

Now you can deploy the app.

### Actual deploy

Just run the following. It should update the code, take care of database migrations and restart the app in PM2

```
yarn deploy
```

Enjoy! üòÅ
